# hello-world
Hello World, I'm learning Github :) <br /> 
I'm following the steps outlined in the  [Hello World guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)  as a starting point. <br /> 
As a Wikipedia editor, I'm seeing some of the ways that Github is similar. <br /> 
As a low-vision person, I'm realizing I need to adjust some settings to make this a bit more accessible. <br /> 
As an artist, I'm looking forward to learning how I might use Github for some of my creative projects. <br />
